# DeepKcrot-Model
The CNN_WE model used for the construction of DeepKcrot

This CNN models are developed using the training data set of Deep-Kcr (https://github.com/linDing-group/Deep-Kcr), stored in the "Models" folder. The models are based on the packges of Tensorflow-1.13.1 and Keras-2.3.1. The training data set and indepedent data set derived from Deep-Kcr can be also found in the "Data" folder. The code deepkcrot.py can be used to call the CNN models in the "Models" folder or train the models using the data in the "Data" folder.
