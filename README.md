# DeepKcrot-Model
Deep-Kcrot

This CNN model was developed using the training data set of Deep-Kcr (https://github.com/linDing-group/Deep-Kcr). This model can be used to identify the potential CDYL-regulated crotonylome. The packges of Tensorflow-1.13.1 and Keras-2.3.1 are used for the development.

The training data set and indepedent data set can be found in the "Data" folder. 

The code deepkcrot.py can be used to call the CNN model in the "Models" folder or train the model directly to make a prediction.
