# DeepKcrot-Model
Deep-Kcrot

Identification of Kcr sites using deep learning accurate detection of lysine crotonylation sites using deep learning method. 

‘deepkcrot.py’ is used to call the DeepKcrot-model in the model folder or train the model directly to make a prediction，the python file used tensorflow-1.13.1, keras-2.3.1.
